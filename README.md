# ps06-shiny-app

For this PS I used the global temperature data provided. This data includes 
the variables region, year, month, and temperature, and provides information
about temperatures in different climates across the globe.

The plot is showing temperature data over time. There is a checkbox group input
to choose between seeing the entire globe, only land temperatures, only ocean
temperatures, or any combination of the three. There is also a radio button
input to select the plot color. This does not change the data, only the visuals.

The table shows the data in an easy to understand way, and the slider input
allows the user to select a range of years to see the data from.
